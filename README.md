# MazeGen
Random Mae Generation in Unity

![Image of Generated Image](/images/random_maze.png)
As shown in the image, there is a random maze generated in unity.

This maze generation simulation uses the recursive backtracking algorithm to generate the maze. 
This program can be extended to create a maze solving robot after the creation of the maze. A left or right wall following algorihtm can be used to make the robot solve the maze
